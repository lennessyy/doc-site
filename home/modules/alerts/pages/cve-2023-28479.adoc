In August 2023, link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28479[CVE-2023-28479]    was filed as a vulnerability with a base severity score of 8.8 affecting TigerGraph’s Enterprise 3.7.0.

*TigerGraph disputes this vulnerability*, as it is based on an assumption that the attacker gains access to the file system of a TigerGraph deployment to execute and modify files in that system,
where the attacker needs to log in to the Docker image using the default username and password.


== Background
The TigerGraph platform incorporates a comprehensive development toolchain, including a compiler, linker, debugger, disassembler, and assembler, within each deployment.
The reported demonstration reveals two critical findings: firstly, an attacker can compile new executables on TigerGraph systems, and secondly, they can alter the system's behavior using the provided toolchain.
Affecting TigerGraph Enterprise Free Edition 3.7.0 Docker Image and TigerGraph Enterprise Free Edition 3.7.0; however, the vulnerability may extend to other TigerGraph products.

== Affected Versions
* All versions

== Assessment
TigerGraph disputes this vulnerability because the exploitation procedure’s initial step requires logging into the Docker image.
It assumes that the attacker gains access to the TigerGraph Docker image and the validity of this assumption is undermined by TigerGraph's documentation, explicitly instructing users to change the Linux user's password in xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:getting-started:docker.adoc#_secure_tigergraph[Step 5], rendering unauthorized login attempts unsuccessful.

Additionally, TigerGraph's docker image is intended solely for local xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:getting-started:docker.adoc[Research and Development (R&D) purposes].

In future versions of TigerGraph, for production deployment, we will recommend users to utilize the k8s operator and k8s docker image.
Notably, the TigerGraph k8s operator deploys a different Docker image devoid of a default password.
Users are also advised to furnish their own key pair for enhanced security.

Further details are provided in our TigerGraph k8s operator link:https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/blob/master/k8s/docs/03-deploy/tigergraph-on-eks.md#providing-a-private-ssh-key-pair-for-enhanced-security[preview documentation] on GitHub.

== Best Practices or Remediations to Secure your Deployment

=== Immediate Remediations
.To summarize, the following best practices should always be followed to ensure your environment is secured:
* In TigerGraph documentation, we specifically ask the user to change the Linux user’s password in xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:getting-started:docker.adoc#_secure_tigergraph[Step 5]. The login attempt, in the proposed exploitation, would not succeed if the user has done so.
* TigerGraph Docker Image is for xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:getting-started:docker.adoc[local R&D only].
* For other installations, such as our documentation on xref:3.9@tigergraph-server:installation:bare-metal-install.adoc#_edit_configuration_file[Installation on Bare Metal], we advise users to change the default username and password.

=== Planned or Proposed Remediations
.In future versions of TigerGraph, for production deployment, we will recommend using the link:https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/tree/master/k8s#tigergraph-operator[k8s operator and k8s docker image]:
* The TigerGraph k8s operator uses a different Docker image which has *NO* default password.
* The user needs to bring their own key pair to be able to use it, see more details link:https://github.com/tigergraph/ecosys/blob/master/k8s/docs/03-deploy/tigergraph-on-eks.md#providing-a-private-ssh-key-pair-for-enhanced-security[here].

We appreciate the diligence of the security community in raising concerns, and we take the security of our products seriously.
TigerGraph is committed to maintaining a robust and secure environment for our users.
